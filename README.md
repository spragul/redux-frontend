This online shopping app is built with Redux and features role-based authentication and authorization. Users have the ability to add products to their cart, make purchases using the Razorpay test payment gateway, and view their order history. Additionally, administrators can manage the product inventory by adding, editing, and deleting products from the product list. The app also provides insights into the number of active users.<hr/>
